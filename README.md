Just a repo with some of the stuffs I found useful
* **en_BD**(custom-locale/en_BD) is a custom locale made from editing en_US that might be helpful for Bangladeshi Linux users who are used to a week starting from saturday and friday as weekly holiday. There are also some minor modifications (like using dd/mm/yyyy format, 12 hour clock, metric system etc)
